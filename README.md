# ***ODROID Flash Tool***
A tool to help flash system images to ODROID SBC devices. The old tool only worked on windows and did not allow flexibility to use compressed archives as a source. I plan to add compression functions for reading and writing of the system image. Along the way a new intreface, support for Linux, and other features will be added.

### *Known Bugs and Current Development:*
- [x] *Add Initial Project* - Begin a new project and migrate source from old project (that will be re-used).
- [x] *Begin new user interface* - Using the mock-up begin generating QML components and UX
- [ ] *Finish feature parity for Windows* - After compression is complete, finish feature parity to replace existing tool.
- [ ] *Establish A Team* - the more Odroidians the better!
