#***ODROID Flash Tool***
A tool to help flash system images to ODROID SBC devices. The old tool only worked on windows and did not allow flexibility to use compressed archives as a source. I plan to add compression functions for reading and writing of the system image. Along the way a new intreface, support for Linux, and other features will be added.
